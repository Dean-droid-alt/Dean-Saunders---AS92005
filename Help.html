    <h1>Why should we fight against climate change?</h1>


    <div class="textbox">
        <div class="intro">

            Climate change won’t just impact forest, or coral reefs, or even people in far-off countries
            – it will affect all of us. From more extreme weather to increasing food prices, to recreation
            and decreased opportunities to appreciate the natural world, people everywhere will feel its
            effects. Reducing our carbon footprint is fundamentally necessary to create a world where
            people and nature thrive – and that’s why Earth's Future is working on it.<br>

            <br>We are fortunate to live in a beautiful, diverse, nurturing, awe-inspiring planet. Our children, and all future generations, deserve the same. <br>

            <br>If you’re feeling worried by now, you’re not alone. Millions of people are working together for our planet.
            Events like Earth Hour are a brilliant reminder that together, humanity is capable of great things, and we can make change happen for the right reasons.<br>

            <br>Already, so much has changed since we first heard about the possible effect of climate change.
            Beginning with the Rio Earth Summit, then the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, action on a
            global scale is speeding up. Now it is more important than ever that we use our action, our votes
            and our voices to tell political and business leaders that action on climate is absolutely essential.<br>

    <h1>What you can do to help</h1>

        <div class="textbox">
            <div class="intro">

            <b>Change your home's source of energy</b>

            <br>Ask your utility company if your home energy comes from oil, coal or gas. If possible, see if you can switch
            to renewable sources such as wind or solar. Or install solar panels on your roof to generate energy for your
            home. Switching your home from oil, gas or coal-powered energy to renewable sources of energy, such as wind or solar,
            can reduce your carbon footprint by up to 1.5 tons of CO2e per year. Learn more about why switching to renewable energy
            is key to tackling the climate crisis.<br>

            <br><b>Reduce, reuse, repair and recycle</b>

            <br>Electronics, clothes, plastics and other items we buy cause carbon emissions at each point in production, from the extraction
            of raw materials to manufacturing and transporting goods to market. To protect the climate, buy fewer things, shop second-hand,
            and repair what you can. Plastics alone generated 1.8 billion metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 – 3.4 percent of
            the global total. Less than 10 percent is recycled, and once plastic is discarded, it can linger for hundreds of years. Buying
            fewer new clothes – and other consumer goods – can also reduce your carbon footprint. Every kilogram of textiles produced generates
            about 17 kilograms of CO2 emissions.<br>

            <br><b>Clean up your environment</b>

            <br>Humans, animals and plants all suffer from land and water contaminated by improperly discarded garbage. Use what you need, and when
            you have to throw something out, dispose of it properly. Educate others to do the same, and participate in local clean-ups of parks,
            rivers, beaches and beyond. Every year, people throw out 2 billion tons of trash. About a third causes environment harms, from choking
            water supplies to poisoning soil.<br>

            <br><b>Plant native species</b>

            <br>If you have a garden or even just a plant or two outside your home, check for native species. Use a plant identification app to help. And then
            think about replacing non-natives, especially any considered invasive. Plants, animals and insects depend on each other. Most insects will not
            eat non-native plants, which means birds and other species lose a food source. Biodiversity suffers. Even a single tree or shrub can offer a refuge – just remember to skip insecticides and other chemicals.<br>

            <br><b>Speak up</b>

            <br>Speak up and get others to join in taking action. It's one of the quickest and most effective ways to make a difference.
            Talk to your neighbors, colleagues, friends, and family. Let business owners know you support bold changes – from plastics-free products
            and packaging to zero-emissions vehicles. Appeal to local and world leaders to act now. Climate action is a task for all of us.
            And it concerns all of us. No one can do it all alone – but we can do it together.<br>
